The growing use of QR codes has resulted in an increase in malicious attacks, such as Quishing and QRLjacking. This Study focuses on the necessity for thorough identification and countermeasure methods to guarantee the security, functionality, and confidentiality of QR codes.  The mentioned QR code attacks can exploit the widely used “login with QR code” functionality, allowing for session hijacking and unauthorised access over accounts. This puts QR code system authentication at risk. In this research by using three advanced machine learning such as LightGBM, SVM, XGBoost and three deep learning BinaryLSTM, DNN, CNN models were able to be identified and reported malicious and non-malicious QR codes using a web application. This research is categorized QR codes as images, overcoming limitations of prior URL analysis methods. Out of these six models only BinaryLSTM and CNN models demonstrated exceptional performance, with almost perfect accuracy in distinguishing between malicious and non-malicious QR codes. The results of manual testing indicated major differences compared to the initial accuracy scores. This study shows the advance QR code security by enabling image-based detection of real threats.
